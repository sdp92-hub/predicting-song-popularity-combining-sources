This project is my first practical application of the basic concepts of Machine Learning I have been learning online. It is linked with my master thesis at ESCP (a French business school).

Three Jupyter Notebooks are available:
  * Database: gathering various sources and defining new variables
  * Data Analysis & Exploration
  * Machine Learning Applications
