# predicting-song-popularity-combining-sources
This project is my first practical application of the basic concepts of Machine Learning I have been learning online. It is linked with my master thesis at ESCP (a French business school).

Three Jupyter Notebooks are available:
  * Database (DB share): gathering various sources and defining new variables.
  * Data Analysis & Exploration.
  * Machine Learning Applications.

And a csv file which is the database resulting from the first notebook. Please note that other changes (new features / deleting features) were made at a later stage.
